                <h3>Der</h3>
                <p>Der is one half of the innovative leadership team behind DerBi Corp Inc Ltd MLM. With a background that blends mechanical engineering and programming, Der’s journey has been one of continuous discovery and exploration. His mind operates at a pace all its own, constantly spinning with ideas that seem to emerge from a place where logic meets creativity. Whether he’s deep in thought or working on the next great thing, there’s always a sense that something truly unique is in the works.</p>
                <p>Der’s ability to inspire is unmatched. People are naturally drawn to his way of thinking, eager to follow where his ideas might lead. His vision for DerBi Corp is something you don’t just hear—you feel it, like an unspoken understanding that this is the start of something important, even if its shape remains just out of focus.</p>
                <p>Challenges are merely opportunities for Der to apply his unconventional problem-solving skills. His resilience in the face of the unexpected keeps DerBi Corp moving forward, always adapting, always evolving.

                <img src="img/Bi.png" alt="Bi, Co-Founder">
                <h3>Bi</h3>
                <p>Bi is the other half of the leadership team at DerBi Corp Inc Ltd MLM, bringing a perspective that is as thoughtful as it is forward-thinking. Originally from Australia, Bi’s approach to environmental engineering and business is driven by a deep commitment to progress. There’s a certain way she views the world, a way that invites others to see beyond the obvious and into the possibilities that lie just beneath the surface.</p>
                <p>Under Bi’s guidance, DerBi Corp has become a place where growth happens organically, guided by a clear vision that resonates on a level that’s more felt than understood. Her leadership style is one that encourages collaboration, drawing people into a shared sense of purpose that, while perhaps not always fully defined, is undeniably compelling.</p>
                <p>Bi’s ability to navigate challenges with grace and adaptability is key to her success. She has a way of finding solutions that seem almost obvious in hindsight, yet are impossible to anticipate. With her at the helm, DerBi Corp is always moving in the right direction, guided by a steady hand that seems to know exactly when to push forward and when to let things unfold naturally.</p>
