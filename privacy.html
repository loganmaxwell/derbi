            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>Your privacy is important to us, so while you’re working your butt off with DerBi Corp inc ltd MLM, rest assured that your personal information is safe with us. Here’s how we handle your data.</p>

            <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
            <p>When you join our network, we collect basic information like your name, email address, and phone number. We also collect data on how you’re moving your butt through our website—this includes tracking how long you’re on our pages, what links you click, and how engaged you are with our content. All this helps us improve our services and tailor our support to get your butt where it needs to be.</p>

            <h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
            <p>Your information is used to provide you with the best possible experience. We use your data to send you updates, special offers, and tips to keep your butt in motion. We may also use your data to analyze trends and improve our services. Don’t worry, though—your butt-related activities stay between us.</p>

            <h3>3. Sharing Your Information</h3>
            <p>We value your privacy and will never sell your information to third parties. However, we may share your data with trusted partners who help us operate our business. These partners are bound by strict agreements to protect your privacy—because no one else needs to know what your butt is up to.</p>

            <h3>4. Cookies and Tracking</h3>
            <p>We use cookies to keep track of how you’re navigating our website. These tiny files help us remember your preferences, so every time you come back, we’re ready to help you get your butt moving again. You can disable cookies in your browser settings, but this might limit your experience on our site.</p>

            <h3>5. Data Security</h3>
            <p>Your data is stored securely and protected by industry-standard measures. We take every precaution to ensure that your butt-related information stays safe from unauthorized access. However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure, so while we strive to protect your data, we can’t guarantee absolute security. Butt we’re doing our best!</p>

            <h3>6. Your Rights</h3>
            <p>You have the right to access, update, or delete your personal information at any time. If you want to change the way we use your data, or if you just want to make sure your butt is being treated right, contact us, and we’ll be happy to help.</p>

            <h3>7. Changes to This Policy</h3>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we’ll post the changes here so you can stay informed. Keep your butt in the loop by checking this page regularly. Continued use of our services after any updates means you accept the new policy.</p>

            <p>If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, please <a href="contact.html">Contact Us</a>.</p>
