                <h3>Is this a pyramid scheme?</h3>
                <p>
                    We get it—a structure that elevates you from the bottom up might look a little triangular. But here at DerBi Corp Inc Ltd MLM, we’re all about supporting you from the rear, so to speak. While our system might resemble a pyramid if you squint hard enough, we prefer to think of it as a progressive platform designed to give you the lift you need. It’s not about stacking people—it’s about creating a strong foundation where everyone’s backside is covered.

                <p>
                    Remember, in a true pyramid scheme, there’s no substance, just a lot of empty space. At DerBi Corp, every level of our structure is filled with value, opportunities, and—most importantly—support for your bottom. So no, it’s not a pyramid scheme; it’s a structured support system designed to help you rise up, butt first.
